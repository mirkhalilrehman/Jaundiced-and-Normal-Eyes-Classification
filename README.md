# Jaundiced-and-Normal-Eyes-Classification
This repository contains code and models for classifying images of jaundiced and normal eyes using deep learning techniques. The project employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to distinguish between images of jaundiced and normal eyes, with an emphasis on preprocessing, model optimization, and regularization. The code implements training with early stopping, learning rate scheduling, and model saving to ensure optimal performance. Additionally, it includes data preprocessing steps such as normalization and data augmentation to enhance model robustness.

Key Features:

CNN architecture for image classification
Early stopping for model convergence
Model saving and checkpointing
Data preprocessing including normalization and augmentation
Performance evaluation and loss tracking
This project is intended to demonstrate an end-to-end solution for image classification problems, with applications in medical imaging.
